            <h2> FALSE DATA INJECTION ATTACK ON OPTIMAL POWER FLOW IN POWER SYSTEMS</h2>
            <p>Now-a-days The technology is becoming advanced day by day the risk of cyber attack is also increasing. In power systems optimal power flow is nothing but the generation of power required for the load demand with the optimal cost of generation this means the way of generating power with least cost. Attacker are attacking on the system and they are changing the data and which is required for calculating the OPF. Due to the change of data the power system gives the sub optimal outputs which may increase the cost of generation.</p>
